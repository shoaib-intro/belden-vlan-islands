RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
[!] Detected 9 VLANs with connectivity issues:
  â€¢ VLAN 30 (WiFi-Corporate): 19 islands, 18 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 31 (WiFi-Guest): 19 islands, 18 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 300 (IoT-Bldg-A): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 301 (IoT-Bldg-B): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 401 (Security-Cameras-B): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 402 (Security-Cameras-C): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 201 (Printers-B): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 400 (Security-Cameras-A): 2 islands, 1 devices isolated
  â€¢ VLAN 1 (Default): 2 islands, 2 devices isolated

ðŸ’¡ Recommended actions:
1. Review physical connectivity between isolated devices
2. Check VLAN configuration on intermediate switches
3. Verify trunk port configurations
4. Consider adding redundant links for critical paths
5. Use network visualization to identify connection gaps

ðŸ”¥ Priority: VLAN 30 has 81.8% of devices isolated - investigate immediately
