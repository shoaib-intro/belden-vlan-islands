# VLAN Islands Detection & Troubleshooting Tool

[![Python 3.9+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.9+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


Thanks for giving me opertunity to built this AI-powered solution to help network administrators analyze topologies, identify VLAN islands, and get interactive guidance for resolving connectivity issues. After dealing with countless VLAN troubleshooting sessions, I wanted to create a tool that could automate this tedious process.

## üåê What are VLAN Islands?

VLAN islands are segments of the same VLAN that are disconnected from each other, creating isolated islands within what should be a unified broadcast domain. This represents a network design flaw that can cause:

- Failed communication between devices that should be able to communicate
- Unexpected routing behavior  
- Difficulty troubleshooting network issues
- Security vulnerabilities due to inconsistent policy enforcement

![alt text](data/diagrams/vlan-island.png)

The diagram above shows VLAN 100 with **3 islands**: one main connected island and two isolated islands that cannot communicate with the main network or each other, despite being in the same VLAN.

## üß† Algorithm Design & Approach

### Core Algorithm: Depth-First Search (DFS)

I chose **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to detect connected components within VLAN subgraphs. After researching and testing multiple approaches, I found DFS to be optimal for this specific problem:

### Algorithm Verification & Correctness

To ensure 100% accuracy, I implemented and tested **4 different algorithms**:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)** - Our primary implementation
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** - Alternative traversal method  
3. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)** - Different algorithmic approach
4. **NetworkX Connected Components** - Industry-standard library

**Result**: All 4 algorithms produce **identical results: 63 islands** ‚úÖ

### Why DFS is Optimal

| Aspect | DFS | BFS | Union-Find | NetworkX |
|--------|-----|-----|------------|----------|
| **Time Complexity** | O(V + E) | O(V + E) | O(V¬∑Œ±(V) + E) | O(V + E) |
| **Space Complexity** | O(V) | O(V) | O(V) | O(V + E) |
| **Memory Usage** | ‚úÖ Minimal | Higher | Moderate | Highest |
| **Cache Locality** | ‚úÖ Excellent | Poor for deep graphs | Good | Variable |
| **Implementation** | ‚úÖ Simple & Clean | Simple | Complex | External dependency |
| **Use Case Fit** | ‚úÖ Perfect for static graphs | Better for shortest paths | Better for dynamic graphs | General purpose |

The flowchart above shows how my DFS-based algorithm processes each VLAN to detect islands through connected component analysis.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

I designed the tool with a modular, extensible architecture for maintainability and scalability. Having worked on several network tools before, I learned the importance of clean separation of concerns:

The architecture diagram shows how I separated data validation, core analysis, AI integration, and multiple interface options into distinct modules.

print(f"Total islands detected: {report.total_islands}")

# Analyze specific VLAN
vlan_result = analyzer.analyze_vlan(30)  # Example: VLAN 30
if vlan_result and vlan_result.has_islands:
    print(f"VLAN 30 has {vlan_result.island_count} islands")
```

## üìä Analysis Results

The tool provides comprehensive analysis with the following key metrics:

### Network-Level Metrics
- **Total Islands**: Total number of disconnected segments across all VLANs
- **Problematic VLANs**: VLANs with 2+ islands (connectivity issues)
- **Healthy VLANs**: VLANs with proper connectivity
- **Fragmentation Statistics**: Overall network health assessment

### VLAN-Level Metrics
- **Island Count**: Number of disconnected segments in the VLAN
- **Fragmentation Ratio**: Percentage of devices not in the main island
- **Main Island Size**: Size of the largest connected component
- **Isolated Devices**: Number of devices disconnected from main network

### Example Output

```
üö® VLAN 30 (WiFi-Corporate): 19 islands detected
   ‚Ä¢ Fragmentation: 81.8% (18 of 22 devices isolated)
   ‚Ä¢ Main island: 4 devices (core-sw-01, core-sw-02, wifi-controller-01, wifi-controller-02)
   ‚Ä¢ Isolated: 18 access points in separate islands

üí° Recommendation: Configure VLAN 30 on intermediate switches to bridge isolated access points
```

## ü§ñ AI Chatbot: Capabilities & Limitations

### üéØ Core Capabilities

I built the AI-powered chatbot using **OpenAI GPT-4** with network-specific context. Here's what I implemented:

#### **Network-Aware Analysis**
- **Topology Understanding**: Knows your exact network structure, devices, and VLANs
- **Context Retention**: Remembers conversation history and network state
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Focuses on relevant VLANs and problematic areas

#### **Interactive Troubleshooting**
- **Natural Language Queries**: Ask questions in plain English
- **Specific VLAN Analysis**: Deep-dive into individual VLAN issues
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Explains why islands formed and impact on network

- **Rate Limiting**: Subject to OpenAI API rate limits

### üîß Configuration & Customization 

The chatbot behavior can be customized through system prompt `chatbot_config.yaml`:

```yaml
system_prompt: "Custom base prompt for your organization"
specialties:
  - name: "Custom Specialty"
    description: "Specialized knowledge area"
```

### Example Conversation

```
You: What VLAN issues do you see in my network?

Assistant: I've analyzed your network and found several VLANs with connectivity issues:
- VLAN 30 (WiFi-Corporate): 19 islands, 81.8% fragmented
- VLAN 31 (WiFi-Guest): 19 islands, 81.8% fragmented  
- VLAN 300 (IoT-Bldg-A): 2 islands, 50% fragmented

The WiFi VLANs are the most problematic - each access point is isolated.

You: How do I fix VLAN 30?

Assistant: To fix VLAN 30, you need to configure it on intermediate switches:

1. **Identify missing VLAN configuration**: The access points are connected but VLAN 30 isn't configured on the access switches

2. **Configure VLAN on access switches**:
   ```cisco
   vlan 30
    name WiFi-Corporate
   interface range gi1/0/1-24
    switchport trunk allowed vlan add 30
   ```

3. **Verify trunk ports**: Ensure all trunk ports between distribution and access switches allow VLAN 30

4. **Test connectivity**: Verify devices can communicate after configuration

Would you like specific configuration examples for your switch models?

## üî¨ Assumptions & Design Decisions

### Network Topology Assumptions

1. **Static Analysis**: Network topology is analyzed as a point-in-time snapshot
2. **Bidirectional Links**: All network links are assumed to be bidirectional
3. **VLAN Membership**: Devices explicitly specify which VLANs they participate in
4. **Layer 2 Focus**: Analysis focuses on Layer 2 connectivity (switching), not Layer 3 routing
5. **No Dynamic Protocols**: Does not consider dynamic protocols like STP, LACP, or VTP state changes

### Data Format Assumptions

1. **JSON Structure**: Input follows the specified JSON schema with devices, links, and VLANs
2. **Unique Identifiers**: All device IDs and VLAN IDs are unique within the topology
3. **Valid References**: All link endpoints reference existing devices
4. **Complete Data**: Topology data includes all relevant devices and connections

### Algorithm Assumptions

1. **Graph Representation**: Network can be accurately represented as an undirected graph
2. **Connected Components**: VLAN islands correspond to connected components in VLAN subgraphs
3. **No Multi-Path**: Multiple physical paths between devices don't affect VLAN island detection
4. **Stable Topology**: Network topology remains stable during analysis

## üß™ Results Verification & Testing

### Multi-Algorithm Verification

To ensure **100% accuracy**, I implemented multiple independent algorithms to verify my results:

```python
# I implemented four different algorithms:
1. Depth-First Search (DFS) - My primary implementation
2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) - Alternative traversal method I tested
3. Union-Find with Path Compression - Different approach I tried
4. NetworkX Connected Components - Industry standard library for comparison

# My verification process:
for each VLAN:
    dfs_result = my_dfs_connected_components(vlan_subgraph)
    bfs_result = my_bfs_connected_components(vlan_subgraph)
    uf_result = my_union_find_components(vlan_subgraph)
    nx_result = networkx.connected_components(vlan_subgraph)
    
    assert dfs_result == bfs_result == uf_result == nx_result
```

### Verification Results

**‚úÖ All my algorithms produce identical results: 63 total islands**

| VLAN ID | VLAN Name | Islands | DFS | BFS | Union-Find | NetworkX |
|---------|-----------|---------|-----|-----|------------|----------|
| 30 | WiFi-Corporate | 19 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| 31 | WiFi-Guest | 19 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| 1 | Default | 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| 300 | IoT-Bldg-A | 2 | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |
| ... | ... | ... | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

### Automated Test Suite

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Run all tests
pytest              # if pytest is in PATH
python -m pytest    # if pytest is not in PATH

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=vlan_islands --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_analyzer.py -v

# Run algorithm verification
python verify_algorithm.py
```

### VLAN Analysis Process

Here's how my algorithm analyzes each VLAN for islands:

![alt text](data/diagrams/algo-analysis.png)

The diagram above shows the complete analysis process I built for VLAN 30, demonstrating how my DFS implementation identifies the main connected component and discovers 18 isolated access points.

### Manual Verification Process

I also manually verified the results through several methods:

1. **Sample Analysis**: I manually traced several VLANs to verify my island detection logic
2. **Edge Cases**: I tested with single-device VLANs, fully connected VLANs, and complex topologies  
3. **Boundary Conditions**: I verified behavior with empty VLANs and disconnected networks
4. **Cross-Validation**: I compared results against network diagrams and expected connectivity

### Correctness Guarantees

I'm confident in the accuracy of my results because:

- **Algorithm Proven**: I used DFS for connected components, which is a well-established, proven algorithm
- **Multiple Verification**: I implemented four independent algorithms that all produce identical results
- **Comprehensive Testing**: I wrote unit tests, integration tests, and did manual verification
- **Real Network Data**: I tested on realistic network topology with 58 devices and 20 VLANs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

I structured the codebase into these main modules:

1. **Data Models** (`models.py`): I defined Pydantic models for devices, links, VLANs
2. **Parser** (`parser.py`): I built JSON topology file parsing and validation
3. **Analyzer** (`analyzer.py`): I implemented the graph-based VLAN island detection algorithm
4. **Reports** (`reports.py`): I created multi-format report generation
5. **Chatbot** (`chatbot.py`): I built the AI-powered troubleshooting assistant
6. **CLI** (`cli.py`): I designed the command-line interface
7. **Visualization** (`visualization.py`): I added network topology visualizations

### Algorithm Details

Here's how I designed the island detection algorithm:

1. **Graph Construction**: I build a NetworkX graph from the physical topology
2. **VLAN Subgraph**: For each VLAN, I create a subgraph containing only participating devices
3. **Connected Components**: I use depth-first search (DFS) to find all connected components
4. **Island Classification**: I identify the largest component as the "main island"
5. **Metrics Calculation**: I calculate fragmentation ratios and connectivity statistics

**Time Complexity**: O(V + E) per VLAN, where V is vertices (devices) and E is edges (links)
**Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for graph storage
